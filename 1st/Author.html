                <p>Diego Pimentel, Brazilian living in Ireland, graduated on Computer Science at Griffith College Dublin.</p>
                <p>Since very young Diego liked to hear and creat stories, with time that feeling grew stronger and he started to create more elaborete short stories. That passion push him to write his first book. But that was not enough, he would like to create something that could be more interactive and complex, that was the moment when he saw a light. Programs could be the answer, but not only programs but also games to tell an story!</p>
                <p>So the discovery of a whole new world begun and I got interested on the creation of data and most important how this data was showed up to the users.
                A well dysplaied website helps not only to cleary shows the content, but also helps out the users to be more alware of all small details the author would like to show.</p>
                <p>It is a powerful way to catch the attention of users and make them more active and interactive with your content. So I started to study Web-development and fell in love for it.</p>
                <p>Now I'm working  on my own project and with time it will come public.</p>
